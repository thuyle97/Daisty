done
>Add garlic, ginger, soy sauce, 1/8 cup water, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil to a medium bowl.
>Add half of the marinade to a ziplock bag and the other half to a small saucepan and set aside. Place salmon fillets in the ziplock bag and marinate for 30 minutes.
>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add salmon filets making sure not to overcrowd the pan (I had to cook two at a time). Cook 3-4 minutes on each side until desired doneness.
>Meanwhile heat the reserved marinade in the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add cornstarch and water to a small bowl and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture to the marinade and simmer until thickened.
>Serve immediately with the teriyaki sauce drizzled on top as well as green onions and sesame seeds for garnish if desired.
