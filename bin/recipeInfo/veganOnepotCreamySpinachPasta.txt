done
>In a large pan on medium heat, melt the vegan butter then saute the garlic for about a minute. Garlic burns super easily, so keep an eye on it.
>Stir in the pasta and vegetable stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan and let simmer for 6-8 minutes or until the pasta is al dente.
>If the pasta has soaked up all the water but isn't tender, add a little more veggie stock as needed and simmer until cooked through.
>Stir in the cream cheese, onion powder, pepper and salt. Reduce the heat to low.
>Fold in the spinach a handful at a time then cover the pan until it has wilted.
>Mix in the lemon juice. If the sauce is too thick, add a little veggie stock or non-dairy milk to thin it out to your desired consistency.
>Serve warm! If you want, top with vegan parmesan.
