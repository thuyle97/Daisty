done
>In a large skillet, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon and set aside on a plate, leaving the grease in the skillet. When the bacon is cool, crumble or chop it.
>Add the radishes and onion to the skillet with the bacon grease, cooking over medium heat. Cook for about 4 minutes, until the onions start to get soft and the radishes start to develop a little color.
>If the pan is getting dry, add the 1/2 tablespoon of butter or olive oil (if thereâ€™s still enough bacon grease, you can proceed without). Add the peppers to the pan and cook for another 4 minutes.
>Stir in the cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Create 4 wells in the veggies and crack an egg into each. Cover and cook until the eggs are cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes.
>Remove from heat. Top with the crumbled bacon, cilantro, and avocado. Enjoy!
